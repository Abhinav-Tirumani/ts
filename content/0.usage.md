## 0. Create a Typescript Project
Obviously You need a starter typescript project to use EasyScript `TYPESCRIPT` version.
Create it using this [link](https://khalilstemmler.com/blogs/typescript/node-starter-project/).

## 1. Install the Package
First, you need to install the package using the following command:

```bash
$ npm install easyscript.ts
```

## 2. Import Modules
Second, you need to import all of the modules you would like to use.

```ts
// List all of the modules you want to use in the brackets
// Example: { flip, print, random }
import { flip } from 'easyscript.ts'
```

## 3. Use EasyScript.ts
Now that you have installed and imported any modules you would like to use, you can now start using them!

```ts
import { print } from 'easyscript.ts'

print("Hello World");
// Hello World
```
